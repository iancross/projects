README for impcore

Ian Cross
Collaborated with Louis and Gabe.
Took approx 7 hours

Note: for most of the problems I added helper functions to handle error
cases. Inititially, most of my solutions were 1 function but i added 
many lines to check for bad input. I wasn't sure if we were supposed
to account for bad input, but i didn't want my program to crash on bad
input. So as a convention, i usually return -1 for bad input except 
where it says otherwise.
