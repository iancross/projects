This file goes with part 7 of the first lab.  The idea is to give you
some practice thinking about the names of functions.  The problem is a
simple one, so we're going the software equivalent of shooting a fly
with an elephant gun, but because the problem is so simple, it makes
it easy to have a short practice session.

Here is the problem:

  - Suggest three different functions that might be useful in
    implementing `brightness`.

  - For each function, suggest three possible names.

  - For each function, say which name you think is most appropriate
    and *why*.



Function #1:

  Job: Finds the sum of the brightness of all of the pixels.

  Candidate names: FindSum, BrightnessSum, BrightSum, PixBright, PixSum

  Best name: BrightSum

  Why the given name is the best: It gives an idea of the purpose of the 
function because it says that it is finding the sum of Brightness of pixels.





Function #2:

  Job:Finds the brightness of a specific pixel

  Candidate names:PixBright, BrightPix, FindBright

  Best name:PixBright

  Why the given name is the best:PixBright sets it apart from BrightSum 
because it says that you are checking the brightness of each pixel.





Function #3:

  Job:Gets the average brightness of the image

  Candidate names:AvgBrightness, AvgBright, ImageBright

  Best name:AvgBright

  Why the given name is the best:Says that we are calculating the average 
brightness of the image.
