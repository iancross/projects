Implementations
---------------------
brightness.c was correctly implemented through the functions 
CheckFile, 
AvgBright, 
SumBright

fgroups.c was correctly implemented through the functions 
input, 
insert_atom,
print_table, 
print_set, 
skip_line, 
record_fingerprint, 
record_name, 
num_fgroups

----------------------
Part C
----------------------
Fingerprint implementation examples:

1. Dictionary - printing word definitions (or simply printing every
word's definition)
2. Mass data retrieval - with a slight modification, you could use a 
keyword to find article, speech, or blog segments that have to do with
a particular keyword. This could be especially important in terms of 
national security. For example, put all blocks of text in a set that have
the fingerprint "making bombs."
3. Verifying the integrity of files or messages - As indicated in the
assignment, the fingerprint can also be considered a message digest. One
can determine if any changes have been made to a message by comparing
message digests calculated before and after the message was sent.
