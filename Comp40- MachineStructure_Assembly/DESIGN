Homework 1 - Fgroups Design 
Ian Cross and Alison Tai

1. Data Structures - What does each pointer-to-void point to?
We are using Hanson's table to hold the fingerprints (key) and the 
corresponding names (values). The void pointer keys are pointing to atoms which
hold the fingerprints string sequence. The void pointer values in the table 
point to sets of the names in the fingerprint group.

2. What invariant holds part way through reading input lines?
One invariant will be that it's not the end of the input (or end of file).
There will be several other tests to check for bad input during this loop, for
example, making sure the fingerprint is of correct size, value appears more 
than once, etc.

3. How will you compute fingerprint groups after input is read?
During the input loop, if the fingerprint is not in the table, the 
fingerprint is added and value is added as a 1 element set. If the fingerprint
is in the table and the value is not already in the set, we add the value to
the corresponding set. If the fingerprint is in the table and also the name is 
in the corresponding value set, we just move on to the next input. 

Once the entire file is input or the user is done inputting, the set of each key
with a set of size greater than 1 is printed as a fingerprint group.
