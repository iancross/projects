One technique we both have incorporated into our programming practice since 
the beginning of the semester is using a single point of truth wherever
possible. This means that, instead of using values throughout our code, we
define them in one place at the beginning of our program and reuse them. For 
example, in the sudoku solver, we declared the dimension of the sudoku puzzle 
to be solved (9x9) as a global constant; all of our loop guards used this 
constant, rather than the number 9. This keeps our code consistent and 
modular. A change in the global constant automatically updates all code using 
this constant to the new value. For example, if a user wanted to run the
sudoku program on a puzzle with dimensions of 12x12, it would require changing
the DIMENSION constant to 12, along with a few other changes. If the DIMENSION
constant had not existed, the number 9 would need to be changed to the number
12 in multiple places throughout the code. This would have been less efficient
and more prone to errors.
