With luck you will have access to two sets
of image rotators.  


About Image Rotation 1:

NOTE: Neither of us had access to our previous image rotation files (on 
the other partner's computer) and we weren't able to do this part. However,
we read each question and discussed how we would go about this. 
Additionally, we felt comfortable answering the unblackedges questions at
the bottom.

  - For a 180-degree fast rotation, what fraction of instructions are
    spent in input and output and what fraction in rotation?
  - For a 180-degree *blocked* rotation (if you have one), what
    fraction of instructions are spent in input and output and what
    fraction in rotation?

About Image Rotation 2:
  - For a 180-degree fast rotation, what fraction of instructions are
    spent in input and output and what fraction in rotation?
  - For a 180-degree *blocked* rotation (if you have one), what
    fraction of instructions are spent in input and output and what
    fraction in rotation?


UNBLACKEDGES

Please put answers to questions here.


  - What fraction of time is spent in I/O as compared with removing
    black edges? 
        Answer: 59.5%
  
  - How long does time ./unblack-edges take?
        Answer: 1.78 seconds
  
  - After making changes requested in the lab handout (steps 1-4), what
    happened to the total time?
        Answer: The new total time was 2.24 seconds which is .46 seconds 
        slower than the depth first search.
  
  - What happened to the fraction of time spent in Bit_put?
        Answer: Initial DFS = 8.58%    Revised BFS = 8.61%
                the fraction of time increased by .03%
  
  - Since the implementation of Bit_put has not been improved, what has
    changed?
        Answer: The major change was the change from seq_addlo to seq_addhi.
                Seq_addlo was 2.64% and then seq_addhi was 2.31%. This is
                a change of approx 20 million instructions.
