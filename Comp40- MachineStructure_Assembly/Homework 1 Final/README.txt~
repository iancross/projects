We received some assistance with syntax from TAs: Eliot, Zeke, and Will.
We also looked at the Wikipedia page for message digests to get ideas
for Part C.

Implementations
---------------------
brightness.c calculates the average brightness of a PGM file. This was
correctly implemented through the functions: 
        CheckFile 
        AvgBright 
        SumBright
and using the following interface:
        pnmrdr - to read and attain necessary data of the PGM file.

fgroups.c calculates [description]. This was correctly implemented through the functions:
        input, 
        insert_atom,
        print_table, 
        print_set, 
        skip_line, 
        record_fingerprint, 
        record_name, 
        num_fgroups
and using the following interfaces:
        table - to store the fingerprints and names
        set - to store the fingerprint groups of names
        atom - to store keys and values in the table and sets.

Part C
----------------------
Fingerprint implementation examples:

1. Dictionary - printing word definitions (or simply printing every
   word's definition)
2. Mass data retrieval - with a slight modification, you could use a 
   keyword to find article, speech, or blog segments that have to do with
   a particular keyword. This could be especially important in terms of 
   national security. For example, put all blocks of text in a set that
   have the fingerprint "making bombs."
3. Verifying the integrity of files or messages - As indicated in the
   assignment, the fingerprint can also be considered a message digest. 
   One can determine if any changes have been made to a message by 
   comparing message digests calculated before and after the message was
   sent.
